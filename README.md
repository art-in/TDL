TODO List (TDL) - lightweight task tracker for daily life.

**Why not use existing solution (handreds of them)?**  
Todo lists are kinda private-everyday-tools that should be just perfect (100%).  
This is personal handmade tool. Everything about it is exactly the way I want it to be.  
With external tools you do not have that level of control.

**General design idea**  
Sufficient minimalism.

**Features:**
- [x] task editing (+ reordering)
- [ ] sub-tasking
- [x] projects (i.e. sports, music, craft, etc.)
- [ ] estimation / actual time for performing task
- [x] history of completed tasks
- [ ] history analysis (total time spent on project/task per time period)
- [ ] keyboard navigation
- [ ] deadline notifications
- [x] mobile devices
